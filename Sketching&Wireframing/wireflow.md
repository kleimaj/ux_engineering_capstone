### The importance of wireflows
- They accurately represent mobile apps and dynamic websites
- They offer a quick way of communicating ideas to 
cross-functional teams

#### How to wireflow
- Use simple wireframes to represent each screen
- Use an arrow to point out a hotspot (or link) and link the arrow to another wireframe that shows the action's result. Use bright colors for hotspots.

### Creating digital wireframes and wireflows

#### Sketch

>If you’re a UX designer and you use a Mac, you may want to consider using Sketch. Sketch is a vector graphics editing tool you can use to design user interfaces and experiences. Check out Sketch's [User Manual](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

#### Adobe Xd

>And what if you're a Windows user? You, too, can create digital wireflows (and much more) using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). It’s made for UX designers, and it’s free! As with Sketch, you can use it to wireframe, design, and prototype.

### Figma

>Another design tool option is Figma: a browser-based platform that’s compatible with both Mac and Windows. As with Sketch and Adobe XD, you can use Figma to design user interfaces and experiences. It also allows you to collaborate with other users in real-time, like Google Docs.
