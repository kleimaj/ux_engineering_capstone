# Usability Testing

Usability refers to how easy and pleasant user interfaces are to use. When a designer says they want to improve usability, they mean ease of use.

### 5 Components of usability

1. **Learnability**: How easily can users accomplish basic tasks the first time they see the design?

2. **Efficiency**: How quickly can they accomplish the tasks?

3. **Memorability**: If someone doesn't use the product for a while, how quick and easy it is for them to get reacquainted with it?

4. **Errors**: How many errors do users make? How severe are they? How can they recover from them?

5. **Satisfaction**: How pleasant or satisfying is it to use the design?



### Usability Heuristics

*Heuristics* are the iron-clad commandments, or consistent rules for interaction design in projects. Refer to [Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

* A common navigational heuristic is users should always know where they are on the site. 
* A common search heurisitc is there should be a search box available on every page of the site.
* A form heuristic is that each input should have a label.

### Usability Testing Process

1. **Prepare** a plan of three or more task scenarios that test user goals and make sure your product works correctly.
     1a. **Prepare Task Scenarios**
    - A *task scenario* is the action you ask the participant to take so you can observe how they use the product.
    - To create task scenarios, ask yourself:
      - *What are the goals a user has when interacting with my product?*
      - *Do I have specific questions about how my design will work in practice?*
      - *Do I need to test a specific interaction or flow?*
    - Example: 
        *You're a single twenty-something traveling for a weekend getaway with your college friends to New York City on March 3â€“March 14. You need to buy both airfare and hotel. Go to the American Airlines website and JetBlue website to see which has the best travel deals for those dates.*
    
    1b. **Prepare a Test Plan**
    - A *test plan* ensures your test is consistent for all participants.
    - A good test plan covers the following elements:
        - A description of what you're testing.
        - Your goals for the usability test.
        - Your testing schedule, environment, and equipment.
        - Information about the users in the test group.
        - Your test script, as well as instructions, scenarios, and steps for each task.
2. **Recruit** participants who resemble your target audience.
    2a. **Early Recruitment**
    - Find participants early on that look like your target user demographic.
    2b. **Participant Quantity**
    - According to usability expert Jakob Nielsen, testing five people wil catch 85% of usability issues with a design. The remaining 15% of issues can be caught with 15 users.

    2c. **Recruiting Methods**
        - Existing Users
        For refining projects, you can test with existing users. [Ethnio](https://ethn.io/) and [UserZoom](https://www.userzoom.com/) are tools that allow you to recruit participants directly from your site.
        - Your Network
        For new designs, you can recruit from your own network with Facebook or LinkedIn. Be careful to avoid bias in who tests your products.
        - Classified Ads
        Classified ads can be a great geography-specific recruiting tool. Use the "gigs" section of Craigslist, newspapers, online message boards.
        - Snowball Recruiting
        Snowball recruiting leverages the networks of participants you recruited and asking them if they know anyone else who would be interested.
3. **Conduct** the usability test in a quiet place with a working prototype.
    3a. **Conducting Effective Tests**
    - Be as hands off as possible. Don't insert yourself into the user experience.
    - Be in a comfortable environment for the user.
    - Ensure the prototype is working ahead of time.
    - Emphasize that the participant isn't being "tested".
    - Encourage the participant to "think aloud".
4. **Analyze** the data to find patterns and problems.
5. **Debrief** the test and determine next steps.
