# Usability Testing

Usability refers to how easy and pleasant user interfaces are to use. When a designer says they want to improve usability, they mean ease of use.

### 5 Components of usability

1. **Learnability**: How easily can users accomplish basic tasks the first time they see the design?

2. **Efficiency**: How quickly can they accomplish the tasks?

3. **Memorability**: If someone doesn't use the product for a while, how quick and easy it is for them to get reacquainted with it?

4. **Errors**: How many errors do users make? How severe are they? How can they recover from them?

5. **Satisfaction**: How pleasant or satisfying is it to use the design?
