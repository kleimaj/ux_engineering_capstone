# Prototyping

### What is a prototype?

A visual representation of a product that a design team puts together during the design process.

##### Prototypes allow UX Designers to:
- Test the flow of a design solution
- Request feedback from users
- Make revisions based on user feedback — all before sending a finalized version to developers

> Prototypes can be low, mid, or high fidelity

### Why do we make prototypes?
**Refinement**
- Similar to sketching, we prototype primarily as a way to refine and explore a concept

**Functionality**
- We can more effectively test functionality with users through prototyping

**Communication**
- We can use prototypes to communicate with our team and additional stakeholders

**User-Centered**
- Prototypes allow us to validate whether or not our designs enable users to accomplish their target goal in an intuitive way.
##### Efficiency
- Production development can get messy with database issues, integration points, code maintainability, quality assurance, deployment, and more. A prototype helps you avoid unnecessary problems.
##### Inclusivity
- Not everyone can code, but most can help with prototyping. It's a way for more people to have input.

### Prototype Fidelity

> When testing *"What something is"*, such as a design concept, a user flow, or user assumptions about a design solution, low-fidelity will work best. 

>If you want to test *"How something works"*, such as specific interactions, animations, or labels on the user interface, high-fidelity will work best.

### Testing with Hi-Fi Prototypes
Hi-fi prototypes test value and functionality. They are also known as "functional" or "clickable" prototypes, because they mimic the response of the system.

When using hi-fi prototypes with users, you'll conduct **usability tests**. These tests allow designers to create task scenarios and instruct users to interact with the prototype.

#### Hi-Fi prototypes are most effective for testing:
- **Flow of screens:** What the user sees and does on the site or app.
- **Motion and gestures:** How the user controls the site or app.
- **Timing:** When the user sees content on the site or app.
- **Expectations:** How the content and flow support what users expect on the site or app.

#### InVision Tutorials
The InVision website provides some [tutorials](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000638763) to familiarize you with the software and prototyping basics.

Be sure to work through all of the content in the “Building Projects” section of the tutorial. This could take several hours, so plan accordingly.

Additionally, download these [Sketch files](https://ga-instruction.s3.amazonaws.com/json/UXF/assets/unit-4/lesson2%263/instagram-mobile.sketch) of wireframes for some screens of the Instagram app. When you get to the lesson on uploading screens, you can use these as sample content.

### Craft Manager
