# Prototyping

### What is a prototype?

A visual representation of a product that a design team puts together during the design process.

##### Prototypes allow UX Designers to:
- Test the flow of a design solution
- Request feedback from users
- Make revisions based on user feedback â€” all before sending a finalized version to developers

> Prototypes can be low, mid, or high fidelity

#### Why do we make prototypes?
##### Refinement
- Similar to sketching, we prototype primarily as a way to refine and explore a concept
##### Functionality
- We can more effectively test functionality with users through prototyping
##### Communication
- We can use prototypes to communicate with our team and additional stakeholders
##### User-Centered
- Prototypes allow us to validate whether or not our designs enable users to accomplish their target goal in an intuitive way.
##### Efficiency
- Production development can get messy with database issues, integration points, code maintainability, quality assurance, deployment, and more. A prototype helps you avoid unnecessary problems.
##### Inclusivity
- Not everyone can code, but most can help with prototyping. It's a way for more people to have input.
