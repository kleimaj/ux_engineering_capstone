Navigation
- Users read web copy incredibly fast (in an F pattern)
- users interact with content differently (depending on device)

- Content Hierarchy: arranging / organizing content on app
  - Main level: core value, helps user complete goal or fulfill a need
    * Focal point, communicates and provides value
  - Supporting: Enhances user engagement with the main content
    * Adds credibility, authenticity, more info to main content
  - Interface: allows users to navigate the experience
    * Provides infrastructure and key functionality (in the F pattern)

Content Hierarchy + Navigation = Success
Tips to designing good navigation
1. Be consistent
2. Use conventional copy (conversational tone most often wins)
3. Avoid ambiguous icons, elements, or labels
4. Keep it simple
5. Keep Depth in Check, limit depth of navigation levels, (don't go more than 3 levels deep)
6. Keep Breadth in Check, limit number of visible menu items

(2 levels of depth, the homepage doesn't count as a level)
