Information Architecture
Web apps have exponentially more info available at any time than any given user need at any moment in time
IA is the practice of taking the information a business must make available to fulfill the needs of all users and organizing it so each user can easily meet their specific requirement at a moment in time

Who does it?
UX Designer mainly. There are many stakeholders in IA. IA is important to development of an SEO strategy. It's relevant to marketing / content team, sales & customer service teams (although they are less likely to drive it)

Four systems of IA (much like the principles of library science)
Organizational Systems - How we group it
  - humans can only process 7 pieces of info at a time
  The progression of an organizational system coincides with the progression of the business 
  * Sequential System - info is presented linearly (step by step) ex. Onboarding flow
  * Hierarchal - Tree like system (site maps, show how navigation is structured, where content sits, relationship between pages, tangible IA deliverable)
  * Matrix - ex. Netflix interface, behind the scenes metadata. 
Labeling Systems - What should we call it
  - never simple, requires lots of user research. Must be consistent labelso
Navigation Systems - How do users move through it
  - (don't think of a nav bar / menu, but more of a user flow)
  - To ensure easy navigation, make noticeable links on a page, remove clutter so users can see the next step, use correct labels, and use sidebars, breadcrumbs, and menus to help users move forward, backward, and out of predicted user flows.
Search Systems - How do users search it?
- Effective search functions requires good metadata. 

Organization & Labeling Systems make up the content hierarchy and taxonomy

4 Fundamental questions users ask:
am i in the right place?
does it have what I want?
what else does it have?
what do I do now?

Navigation & Search are a result of the users interacting with the content
