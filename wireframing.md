# Sketching and Wireframing

### The Importance of Sketching
- By creating the first iteration of our designs with paper and pen, we decrease cost and risk.
- Sketches are cheap and can be done very early on to articulate ideas incredibly quickly.

> It's not art, it's *visual communication*

- 12 basic shapes that are building blocks to create anything
- If you break down many popular sites, you can analyze the visual alphabet they used initially.

### What are Wireframes?
- Low-fidelity, simplified outlines of your product.
- The blueprint, or skeletal framework of your product.

#### 2 Questions the wireframe should answer
1. *How will customers use your product?*
2. *How will your product solve your customer's pain points?*

#### Components of Wireframes
- General layout of a screen
- Design Patterns (i.e hamburger menu)
- Placeholders (for images and other things)
- Annotations (to communicate ideas)

#### The Importance of Wireframing
- Great for fast iterations
- Easier to fix a problem during wireframing than in code
- Powerful way to communicate design vision

##### What wireframes don't include
- Colors
- logos, special ui elements or custom fonts
- images (use a placeholder)

##### Additional Tips
- Keep Navigation in Mind
  - Think about what users see at all times, what actions are available?
- Prioritize Content
  - Don't show every element of your site or app on every screen
  - Remember 80/20 Rule: 80% of users only use 20% of features. Not all functionality is equally accessible. Focus on most important features.
