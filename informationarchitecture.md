# Information Architecture
* Web apps have exponentially more info available at any time than any given user need at any moment in time
* IA is the practice of taking the information a business must make available to fulfill the needs of all users and organizing it so each user can easily meet their specific requirement at a moment in time

### Who does it?
UX Designer mainly. There are many stakeholders in IA. IA is important to development of an SEO strategy. It's relevant to marketing / content team, sales & customer service teams (although they are less likely to drive it)

### Four systems of IA (much like the principles of library science)

#### 1. Organizational Systems - How we group it
  - humans can only process 7 pieces of info at a time
  The progression of an organizational system coincides with the progression of the business 
  * Sequential System - info is presented linearly (step by step) ex. Onboarding flow
  * Hierarchal - Tree like system (site maps, show how navigation is structured, where content sits, relationship between pages, tangible IA deliverable)
  * Matrix - ex. Netflix interface, behind the scenes metadata. 

#### 2. Labeling Systems - What should we call it
  - never simple, requires lots of user research. Must be consistent labelso

> Organization & Labeling Systems make up the content hierarchy and taxonomy

#### 3. Navigation Systems - How do users move through it
  - (don't think of a nav bar / menu, but more of a user flow)
  - To ensure easy navigation, make noticeable links on a page, remove clutter so users can see the next step, use correct labels, and use sidebars, breadcrumbs, and menus to help users move forward, backward, and out of predicted user flows.

#### 4. Search Systems - How do users search it?
- Effective search functions requires good metadata. 

### 4 Fundamental questions users always ask:
1. *Am I in the right place?*
2. *Does it have what I want?*
3. *What else does it have?*
4. *What do I do now?*

Navigation & Search are a result of the users interacting with the content
